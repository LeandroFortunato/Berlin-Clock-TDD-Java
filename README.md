The Berlin Clock

The Berlin Clock is composed of four rows of lights and a yellow lamp on the top (see picture above for reference).

* The top yellow light blinks every couple of seconds (on for even seconds, off for odd seconds).
* The top two rows represent hours. The lights on the top row represent five hours each, while the bottom row lamps represent one hour each.
* The bottom two rows represent minutes. Again, each third-row lamp represents 5 minutes, so there are 11 of them. Each bottom row lamp represents one minute.

For example, 4 pm (16 hours) is represented by 3 lamps on of the first row and 1 light on of the second row (3x5 + 1). Equally, 27 minutes is represented by 5 lights on the third row and 2 on the very bottom row (5x5 + 2).

You may notice that lamps on the third row are all yellow, apart from the 3rd, 6th and 9th lamps which show quarters of an hour. This is just a visual convenience as they still represent 5 minutes like the yellow lamps.

Here is the colour code for lamps:
Y = Yellow
R = Red
O = Off

Here are some examples:


00:00:00    Y OOOO OOOO OOOOOOOOOOO OOOO

13:17:01    O RROO RRRO YYROOOOOOOO YYOO

23:59:59    O RRRR RRRO YYRYYRYYRYY YYYY

24:00:00    Y RRRR RRRR OOOOOOOOOOO OOOO
